* BruteForce (recursion) + Memoization (Top Down Manner)
* Dynamic Programming (Iteratively, Tabulation) (Bottom Up Manner)
* memset(dp, -1, sizeof memo) : memo[i] = -1; means it has not been precomputed yet,we'll use this -1 to avoid recursive call (Memoization).
* what does your recursive function do?
* How many parameters does the function require?
